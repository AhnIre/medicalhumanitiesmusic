# Miracle in Cell No.7

The song "Angel's Song," part of the Miracle in Cell No. 7 soundtrack, expresses the pure and heartfelt relationship between Yong-gu, a father with an intellectual disability, and his daughter Ye-seung through music. The piece was composed by Lee Dong-jun, with the Sunae Elementary School Choir featuring to add an extra layer of emotion through their clear and innocent voices.
