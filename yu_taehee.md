# Coda

Ruby is torn between her deaf parents and the responsibility of protecting the only family community in the world, and her longing for her dream of singing. At first, she had a clear and simple view of the world, but as time passed, she came face to face with the reality that she might not be able to fully have her beloved family and her future at the same time. These growing pains overlap exquisitely with the lyrics of "Both Sides Now." In particular, the lyrics "I really don't know life at all" contain a deep emptiness and sadness that no matter how hard you try, you can't fully understand life, which naturally draws the audience to Ruby's confusion and tears.

Example: A movie similar to CODA is Sound of Metal (2019).Both films center around deafness and explore themes of identity and community through the experience of losing or living without sound. They also share a commitment to authentic representation, including casting deaf actors in key roles.
