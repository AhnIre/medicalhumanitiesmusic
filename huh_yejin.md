# The Girl Who Drank the Moon

 Based on the content, the background of the times is estimated to be similar to that of the Middle Ages, but the treatment of schizophrenia in the Middle Ages was mean, hateful, and just treated like a madman. The content of the novel about this part is as follows. For some reason, the director nun confines a mad woman who can use magic in a tower, tortures and torments the woman in order to get something out of her.

 Through the lyrics of the music, other nuns see that a crazy woman suffers from schizophrenia, and a crazy woman is treated with violence, ignored, and imprisoned by the director nun because she has schizophrenia. Even if a woman hits a wall and scratches herself, she treats her like a crazy person without treating her.
