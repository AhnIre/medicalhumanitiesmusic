# Untouchable

Ludovico Einaudi’s Fly delicately portrays the fragility of human existence and the inner strength that rises above it. Through repetitive ostinato patterns and a gradual intensification of dynamics, the music evokes a physical willpower that pushes beyond the limits of the body. The piece begins with a gentle, almost hesitant piano melody, as if cautiously reaching out to embrace life once more. As the rhythm builds and the volume increases, a quiet but persistent energy emerges—suggesting not resignation, but a forward-moving drive.

This emotional arc becomes even more compelling in the film Untouchable, where Fly accompanies the scene in which Driss drives Philippe, a man with quadriplegia, through the city at high speed. The camera captures their shared exhilaration: the wind, the motion, and the open road. [Einaudi’s light yet persistent rhythm fills the background, momentarily freeing both the characters and the viewers from the visible presence of disability. In this moment, Philippe’s condition is not denied but transcended—his laughter and sense of vitality take center stage.](https://youtu.be/kYiIsoMVQCY?si=lKGutVNQBCU8gxVj)

Thus, the music doesn’t convey pity or sorrow. Instead, it quietly illuminates the soaring spirit of a man who, though confined to a wheelchair, finds moments of freedom and joy. Fly becomes a metaphorical flight—subtle but resolute—of the human will that continues to move, even when the body cannot.

The same disease is described in Thea Sharrock’s 2016 film [*Me Before You*](kim_minjung.md). Me Before You and The Intouchables both revolve around the lives of quadriplegics, but they differ greatly in how they portray and deal with the disease. Will in Me Before You becomes paralyzed from the neck down after a motorcycle accident, loses his will to live, and decides to commit assisted suicide. He briefly finds hope through his relationship with his caregiver, Louisa, but ultimately chooses to take his own life. On the other hand, Philippe in The Intouchables becomes paralyzed from the neck down after a paragliding accident, but he regains his vitality after meeting his free-spirited caregiver, Driss, and he accepts his disability through humor and human relationships. Both films realistically portray the physical difficulties of quadriplegic life, but they convey contrasting messages: Me Before You is emotional and tragic, while The Intouchables looks at the disease from a bright and cheerful perspective.
