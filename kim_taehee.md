# 말아톤(film maraton)

“Run, Cho-won” is featured in the film’s climactic final marathon sequence, a pivotal moment where the protagonist, who has autism spectrum disorder, overcomes both physical and emotional challenges. Composer Kim Joon-sung employs a delicate interplay of piano and strings, starting with a soft, hesitant melody that mirrors Cho-won’s initial uncertainty and intense focus. As the scene progresses and Cho-won finds his rhythm, the music swells with warm, sweeping string harmonies, symbolizing his growing confidence and emotional liberation.
This musical transformation closely aligns with the visual narrative: as Cho-won runs through the final stretch, supported by his mother’s unwavering encouragement, the rising tempo and harmonic resolution of the score create a sense of triumph—not just of finishing the race, but of transcending isolation. The music doesn’t romanticize or pity him; rather, it articulates the complexity of his emotions with honesty and grace.
By doing so, the score challenges conventional portrayals of disability. It presents Cho-won’s inner world not as “special” or “other,” but as deeply human and universally relatable. The music thus invites viewers to see autism not as a barrier to connection, but as a different, equally valid way of experiencing life and feeling deeply.

The ballad featured in the drama It’s Okay, [That’s Love delicately portrays the emotional journey of Jang Jae-yeol](https://youtu.be/6nM9hL95LzA?si=K-sWANjdfgn4h9jX), who suffers from schizophrenia. Its lyrical melody and emotionally charged vocals express the confusion he experiences between reality and illusion, his deep sense of loneliness, and the complex emotions within his romantic relationship. The music serves as a medium that conveys his vulnerability and his hope for healing.

This method of expressing psychological distress and emotional depth through music is closely related to the film Marathon, which I analyzed separately.[*It's Okay, That's Love*](do_gwanwoo.md) Although Marathon deals with autism—a different subject—it shares a common approach in using music to reveal the protagonist’s inner world. In particular, the piece Run, Cho-won communicates Cho-won’s emotions without words, allowing the audience to feel his experience. The music functions not just as background, but as a narrative device that adds depth to the character’s emotional arc.
