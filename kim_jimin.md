# keys to the heart 

﻿In the movie Keys to the Heart, Brahms' "Hungarian Dance No. 5" serves as a symbolic piece that vividly portrays Jin-tae’s autism spectrum disorder and savant syndrome. This piece is prominently featured during a pivotal scene where Jin-tae expresses his emotions through piano. He delivers a flawless performance of the fast-paced and intense "Hungarian Dance No. 5," marking a key moment of connection with his older brother Jo-ha. The scene highlights Jo-ha's shock and amazement as he witnesses Jin-tae, whom he had underestimated, immersed in a world of music as if it were second nature to him. The portrayal of Jin-tae at the piano—unsteady yet deeply focused—conveys his inner world bursting forth through the music, offering a glimpse into his complex emotions and extraordinary talent.
Jin-tae’s condition, known as savant syndrome, refers to a rare phenomenon in which individuals with autism spectrum disorder exhibit exceptional abilities in specific areas.While Jin-tae struggles with verbal communication and relies on assistance for daily tasks, he possesses an extraordinary talent for music. He can flawlessly replicate a piece after hearing it just once and instinctively grasps intricate rhythms and structures in music. His talent goes beyond technical proficiency, as he conveys profound emotion and depth through his performances.
The film does not view Jin-tae’s disability as a deficit but instead reveals the hidden richness of his world.In the piano scene, the rapid tempo and complex rhythms of "Hungarian Dance No. 5" mirror Jin-tae’s inner turbulence and flashes of brilliance. His performance symbolizes his unique way of connecting with others and expressing himself, allowing the audience to see him not merely as someone with a disability but as an individual with extraordinary talents and a deeply sensitive soul.
[Ultimately, the movie uses music to beautifully and movingly depict Jin-tae’s world, celebrating the unique richness of his life and presenting his journey with warmth and humanity.](https://youtu.be/Jyqs-fyUrpk?si=uIIzP5G2rxdUWq66)


Example: The two works explore similar themes through different conditions—savant syndrome and schizophrenia. [*A Beautiful Mind*](lee_eunbi.md). Keys to the Heart uses Brahms’ Hungarian Dance No. 5 to portray the complex emotions and genius of a character with autism and savant syndrome, illustrating a world where unique sensitivity and talent coexist. On the other hand, A Beautiful Mind expresses the inner pain of schizophrenia through the song “All Love Can Be,” while also highlighting enduring love and hope. In both cases, the films present disability or mental illness not as mere deficiency, but as a unique emotional world filled with human beauty and depth.
