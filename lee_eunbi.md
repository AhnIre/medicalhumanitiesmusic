# A Beautiful Mind

The song  ["All Love Can Be"](https://youtu.be/Kajazfzb0Ow?feature=shared) features a gentle orchestral backdrop and a tender vocal performance that beautifully reflect the emotional core of A Beautiful Mind. Its calm yet deeply expressive tone captures the invisible struggles that John Nash faces as he lives with schizophrenia — a chronic mental disorder that affects a person’s ability to think clearly, manage emotions, and relate to others. In Nash’s case, this condition manifests through vivid hallucinations and deeply rooted delusions, which distort his perception of reality and complicate his personal and academic life.

Rather than simply portraying despair, the music conveys the quiet strength and resilience Nash develops as he learns to live with his condition. The gradual layering of orchestral elements mirrors his journey from confusion to clarity, and from fear to fragile trust. This emotional progression is underscored during a pivotal scene in the film — when Nash is honored for his lifetime of academic achievement, with his wife Alicia by his side. It is in this scene that “All Love Can Be” plays, emphasizing not only Nash’s public recognition, but also his private triumph over illness. The song thus becomes a symbol of both enduring love and the inner battles he continues to face.

Understanding the nature of schizophrenia adds further depth to the listening experience. The music’s subtle harmonic shifts and layered textures symbolize the dissonance between Nash’s inner world and external reality — the blurring line between illusion and truth. By aligning this emotional tension with the film’s narrative arc, the song enhances our empathy for Nash and reinforces the central message of the film: even amidst the chaos of the mind, love and human connection can remain powerful sources of healing.

#나의 장례식에서 흘러나왔으면 하는 음악
[Erik Satie – Gymnopédie No.1](https://youtu.be/S-Xm7s9eGxU)

This piece has a slow and gentle melody that feels like it momentarily pauses the flow of time. Rather than evoking intense sadness, it offers a quiet sense of comfort and acceptance. I chose this music because I believe it can bring peace and calm to those present at my funeral, creating an atmosphere of quiet reflection. I hope this piece will help my final moments be remembered with warmth and serenity.


#질병서사 플레이리스트
질병에 대한 서사로 저는 제 이야기를 해보려합니다. 독감유행시기에 독감 예방주사를 맞지않으면 늘 독감에 걸리곤 했습니다. 갑자기 오한이 몸을 덮치고, 체온계가 39도를 가리키며 근육통으로 인해 온몸이 쑤시면 '아, 독감에 걸렸구나' 하며 깨닫곤 했습니다. 약을 먹기 싫어해서 그렇게 아프면서도 일부러 약을 거르곤 했던 어린시절의 기억, 그리고 독감에 걸린 내내 정신이 몽롱했고 머리는 깨질듯이 아팠던 그때의 경험을 담아 [해당 플레이리스트](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqyok87vsw8oUxPJwFp8SWFPUS4li0qhL&feature=shared)를 만들었습니다. 베토벤의 교향곡 5번 1악장은 독감을 직감했을때의 감정, 드뷔시의 목신의 오후 전주곡은 정신이 흐릿해지는 경험을 드러내고자 하였고, 쇼스타코비치의 교향곡 11번 1악장은 제가 느꼈던 고통을 표현하고자 넣었습니다.
