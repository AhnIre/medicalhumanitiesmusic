# Keys to the Heart (그것만이 내 세상)

In the film, the protagonist, Intae, has savant syndrome and possesses a genius-level talent for the piano. At the Frederic Gala Concert, he gives a brilliant performance of Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1, earning a standing ovation and thunderous applause from the audience. The performance of this piece serves as a symbolic device to overcome the prejudice surrounding his condition.(https://youtu.be/fLt6uvYrxRk?si=cRNHLoz3sFVuJv5c)

I thought this work was similar to mine because it also showed how music is used in a story about overcoming and growing. Mamoru Hosoda's 2021 musical [*Belle : The Dragon and the Freckled Princess](huh_yejin.md). The musical Belle's A Million Miles Away
