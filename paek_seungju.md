# wonder

In artistic works, music often mirrors the inner world of characters with illnesses or disabilities, acting as an emotional translator. Soft, hesitant melodies can reflect vulnerability, while discordant harmonies portray internal struggles and isolation. Music bypasses the need for words, allowing audiences to feel the silent battles and invisible pains that the characters endure. In this way, it becomes not just background sound, but a profound voice for experiences that are otherwise difficult to express.

"Wonder" shows problems to overcome in nature, solving problems positively and continuing to survive. In this respect, [*The Left Foot*](jiang_jingrong.md). can only be used with the left foot, but it is very similar that it still solves problems positively.
