# THE SUBSTANCE

[In the movie](https://youtu.be/JN0c6H4vrrQ?si=Fusd9wpKnTxxPM3H), Elizabeth is a once-successful actress in her 50s who gets fired from hosting a fitness show simply because of her age. Afterward, she falls into despair over her aging self. However, she encounters a drug called "Substance," which gives her the chance to transform into a younger version of herself in her 20s. She names this younger self "Sue" and sends her to take over as the new host of the show. When Sue hosts the show for the first time, the song "Pump It Up" plays, and she performs intense moves that proudly show off her rejuvenated body. 

Example: In [*keys to the heart*](jimin10194895), though it is not the exact same condition, jintaeâ€™s psychological dissociation can be interpreted in relation to The Substance, in which the protagonist is split into two distinct identities, Elizabeth and Sue, exhibiting both physical and mental separation.
