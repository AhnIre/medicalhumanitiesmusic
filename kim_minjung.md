# Me Before You

In the film Me Before You, Imagine Dragons' "Not Today" is used in the scene after Will has chosen assisted death and passed away. Louisa travels to Paris, carrying Will's final message to "live well" in her heart. As she reads his letter and sits alone at a café, "Not Today" plays in the background, subtly expressing her emotions of sorrow mixed with a tentative hope for a new beginning. The gentle melody and lyrics of the song create an atmosphere that accepts the pain of parting while offering the courage to move forward. Through this music, the film deepens the meaning of human resilience and recovery even in the face of extreme situations like living with quadriplegia.

[In one of the film's most memorable scenes](https://youtu.be/6tz1_znrbmc?si=IgBvV3iQmIPJt7Oh), “Not Today” plays during the ending credits of Me Before You, following the emotional farewell between Louisa (Lou) and Will. As Lou moves forward in life after Will’s death, the song underscores her quiet strength and bittersweet hope for the future. The music video and song serve as a heartfelt epilogue to the film. If you’ve watched Me Before You, listening to this track will likely bring back all the feelings of love, loss, and hope that the movie conveys.
