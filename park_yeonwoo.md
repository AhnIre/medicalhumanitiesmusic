# The Fall

[Beethoven's *Symphony No. 7, 2nd movement*](https://youtu.be/Urv9aruTups?si=SoZgX20_iMUX2C_B) symbolizes his physical disability and helplessness through its slow, repetitive rhythms. At the same time, the gloomy yet beautiful melodies express his inner turmoil and emotional explosion. The music reflects both the despair he experiences and the hope he seeks through the heroic story he imagines in his fantasies. Thus, the music emotionally underscores Roy's pain and his struggle to break free from it, deeply conveying his psychological state to the audience. Ultimately, the music portrays his disability not just as a physical limitation, but as a complex experience that leads to a journey of mental healing.

Example: The similar disease(paralysis) is described in Olivier Nakache 2011 film [*The Intouchables*](kim_naeun.md). The piano music *'Una Martina'* of "The Intouchables" depicts the protagonist's physical disability in three dimensions, similar to the symphony of "The Fall". Both songs have similar atmospheres that reveal the bitter and empty heart of the protagonist and at the same time give hope in the heart.
