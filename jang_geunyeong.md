# Wozzeck

In Wozzeck, Alban Berg uses dissonance, atonality, and irregular rhythms to reflect the protagonist’s mental instability. By employing twelve-tone techniques that abandon traditional tonal structure, the music creates a sense of disorientation that mirrors Wozzeck’s psychological breakdown. Rather than serving as background, the music acts as a central force that draws the audience into his disturbed inner world.
